PREREQUISITES
=============
This sample program requires     

    - TG_HOME environment variable must be set. TG_HOME refers to installation 
      path where TayzGrid is installed. 

      To set TG_HOME For Linux: 

        - Open shell.
		- Type "export TG_HOME=/opt/tayzgrid" without quotes and press ENTER key. 
          Replace /opt/tayzgrid with the actual installation path if you have 
          installed TayzGrid on non-default location. 


      To set TG_HOME For Windows: 
        - Open Command Prompt.
        - type 'set TG_HOME="C:\Program Files\TayzGrid\"' without quotes 
          and press enter. 

    - jdk1.6 or higher
    - Netbeans v6 or later if you are using NetBeans to build and 
      run the project.
	  
However any other preffered method can TayzGrid to compile the source 
located at $TG_HOME/samples/events/src/


HOW TO CONFIGURE
=================
This sample program TayzGrids local cache "mypartitionedcache" for operations. 

Local cache "mypartitionedcache" can be started via:

    - startcache tool.
     - startcache tool located at $TG_HOME/bin/startcache.sh (linux)
     - startcache tool located at %TG_HOME%/bin/tools/startcache.bat (windows)

         OR

    - tayzgrid Manager currently shipped only for Windows.

This sample program requires the event notifications to be turned on
for local "mycache".
    On Linux: Event notifications can be turned on/off by modifying the 
    cache config file. Add 
    <cache-notifications item-remove="true" 
        item-add="true" 
        item-update="true" 
    cache-clear="true"/> to cache-settings section of local "mycache".
   
    On Windows: Open TayzGrid Manager.
    - Add "mycache" to Local Caches list.
    - Click "mycache" and Goto the options tab.
    - Check all event notifications in Notifications group.
    - Save and apply configuration.

To Compile and Run via NetBeans:

    - Open Netbeans IDE.
    - Select File->Open Project
    - Locate $TG_HOME/samples/events
    - Add all .jar files to project libraries located at:
           - $TG_HOME/lib
           - $TG_HOME/lib/resources
    - Choose Run -> Clean and Build Project (Shift-F11)
