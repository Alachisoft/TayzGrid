				TayzGrid JSP Sessions Sample Program
====================================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS SAMPLE 
======================
This sample program demonstrates the usage of TayzGrid with JSP Sessions.


CONVENTIONS
===========
For Linux  : $TG_HOME refers to installation path where TayzGrid is 
             installed.        

For Windows: %TG_HOME% refers to the installation path where TayzGrid is 
             installed.

             
PREREQUISITES
=============
This sample program requires     

    - TG_HOME environment variable must be set. TG_HOME refers to installation 
      path where TayzGrid is installed. 

      To set TG_HOME For Linux: 

        - Open shell.
		- Type "export TG_HOME=/opt/tayzgrid" without quotes and press ENTER key. 
          Replace /opt/tayzgrid with the actual installation path if you have 
          installed TayzGrid on non-default location. 


      To set TG_HOME For Windows: 
        - Open Command Prompt.
        - type 'set TG_HOME="C:\Program Files\TayzGrid\"' without quotes 
          and press enter. 

    - jdk1.6 or higher
    - Netbeans v6 or later if you are using NetBeans to build and 
      run the project.

However any other preferred method can be used compile the source 
located at $TG_HOME/samples/sessions/src/

By default this sample application use the 'mypartitionedcache' to store the session data. 
So make sure that cache 'mypartitionedcache' exist in the 'client.conf' with correct 
server ip address and this cache should be started. 

Note : $TG_HOME refers to the location where TayzGrid is installed.


Application Configuration
=========================

You need to add the required libraries into project libraries located at:
   
    - $TG_HOME/lib
    - $TG_HOME/lib/resources
    - $TG_HOME/lib/integrations/tg-sessionprovider.jar
        
    
After adding the required libraries to your application, you need to add the 
filter in the deployment descriptor of your web application. The class file 
containing the filter implementation is ‘com.alachisoft.tayzgrid.web.session.TayzGridSessionProvider‘.

To ensure the correct caching of sessions, you must apply this filter as the
first filter in your deployment descriptor. Filters are executed in the 
order they are defined in deployment descriptor. To create a filter, you must 
define it first under the <filter> tag and then provide a URL mapping for the 
filter using <filter-mapping> tag. The following filter configuration means that 
the filter will be applied to all the URLs in a web application. 

   <filter> 
    <filter-name>TayzGridSessionProvider</filter-name> 
    <filter-class>com.alachisoft.tayzgrid.web.session.TayzGridSessionProvider</filter-class> 
   </filter> 
   <filter-mapping>
        <filter-name>TayzGridSessionProvider</filter-name>
        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
   </filter-mapping>

    TayzGrid session filter should be configured with following parameter. 
   <init-param>
            <description>configPath is used to load the client.conf</description>
            <param-name>configPath</param-name>
            <param-value>TG_HOME/config</param-value>
   </init-param>
   
   TG_HOME is the location where TayzGrid is installed.

Build Application
=================

Follow these steps to successfully build the project in NetBeans.

	- Open the project at the following location ‘$TG_HOME/samples/sessions/netbeans/’ in the NetBeans environment. 

	- Make sure that project references all the libraries located at:
     - $TG_HOME/lib/
     - $TG_HOME/lib/resources
     - $TG_HOME/integrations/tg-sessionprovider.jar
   
	- Build the project, it will generate the ‘GuessGame.war’ file in the following location 
      $TG_HOME/samples/sessions/dist

	  
Application Deployment
======================
The 'GuessGame.war' file can be located at $TG_HOME/samples/sessions/dist/

TOMCAT
======

Note: Following instructions are used for Tomcat version 6.0.29. Steps remain the same but 
the location of the files might change depending upon the version of the tomcat.

	- Stop server.

	- TayzGrid uses 'log4j' for logging. Place the 'log4j' at the following location. 
      $CATALINA_HOME/lib
      $CATALINA_HOME is the location where Tomcat is installed.

	- Create the 'log4j.properties' file with the following contents.
   
	  log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, R 
	  log4j.appender.R=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender 
	  log4j.appender.R.File=${catalina.home}/logs/tg-guessgame.log 
	  log4j.appender.R.MaxFileSize=10MB 
	  log4j.appender.R.MaxBackupIndex=10 
      log4j.appender.R.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout 
	  log4j.appender.R.layout.ConversionPattern=$p $t $c - $m$n

	- Place 'log4j.properties' in the following location.
      $CATALINA_HOME/lib
      $CATALINA_HOME is the location where Tomcat is installed.

	- Download the 'commons-logging-x.x.x-bin.zip' from http://commons.apache.org/logging/download_logging.cgi, extract it and copy the 
      commons-logging-x.x.x.jar file into the following location.
      $CATALINA_HOME/lib
      $CATALINA_HOME is the location where Tomcat is installed.

	- Restart server.

	- Deploy the 'GuessGame.war' file, it must be copied into the correct 
	  directory so Tomcat can find it.  
	  Move the file to the directory $CATALINA_HOME/webapps.
      "$CATALINA_HOME" is the location where Tomcat is installed.  

	- Open the web browser and try to access the following url: 
      http://localhost:8080/GuessGame/index.jsp (specify correct host and port 
	  according to the system specifications).
      Where 'host' will be the address/IP of the machine where Tomcat is installed in case 
	  of local machine it should be 'localhost' and 'port' where Tomcat is listening the request. 
	  Make sure that you are using the correct port. The default port for Tomcat is 8080.

	  
JBoss
=====

	- TayzGrid uses 'log4j' for logging. JBoss by default uses 'log4j' for logging so no need to place it.

	- Deploy the 'GuessGame.war' file, it must be copied into the correct directory so JBoss can find it.  
      Move the file to the directory $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy.
	  "$JBOSS_HOME" is the location where JBoss is installed.  

	- Open the web browser and try to access the following url: 
      http://localhost:8080/GuessGame/index.jsp (specify correct host and port 
	  according to the system specifications). Where 'host' will be the address/IP of
	  the machine where JBoss is installed in case of local machine it should be 'localhost' 
	  and 'port' where JBoss is listening the request. Make sure that you are using 
	  the correct port. The default port for JBoss is 8080.


WEBLOGIC
========

	- TayzGrid uses 'log4j' for logging. Place the 'log4j' at the following location and restart server: 
      $WEBLOGIC_HOME/user_projects/domains/DOMAIN_NAME/lib
      $WEBLOGIC_HOME is the location where WebLogic is installed.
      DOMAIN_NAME is the domain already created.

	- Deploy the 'GuessGame.war' file, it must be copied into the correct directory so 
	  WebLogic can find it.  Move the file to the directory 
      $WEBLOGIC_HOME/user_projects/domains/DOMAIN_NAME/autodeploy
      $WEBLOGIC_HOME is the location where WebLogic is installed.  
      DOMAIN_NAME is the domain already created.
 
	- Open the web browser and try to access the following url: 
      http://localhost:7001/GuessGame/index.jsp (specify correct host and port
	  according to the system specifications). Where 'host' will be the address/IP of 
	  the machine where WebLogic is installed in case of local machine it should be 'localhost'.
      and 'port' where WebLogic is listening the request. Make sure that you are using the correct port. 
      The default port for WebLogic is 7001.

	  
WEBSPHERE
=========

	- TayzGrid uses 'log4j' for logging. Place the 'log4j' at the following location and restart server: 
      $WEBSPHERE_HOME/AppServer/lib/ext
      $WEBSPHERE_HOME is the location where WebSphere is installed.

    - If WebSphere is installed properly, you will be able to access the admin console through 
	  browser with the help of the following url: http://ip-address:port/ibm/console/ 
      By default, 9060 is the port used by WAS. Make sure that your are using the 
	  correct port if you changed it during installation.

    - You can go to Applications -> New Application -> New Enterprise Application.
