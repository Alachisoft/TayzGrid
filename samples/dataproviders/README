      TayzGrid Data Providers Sample Program
========================================================================

PURPOSE OF THIS SAMPLE 
=======================  
This sample program demonstrates the usage of Data Providers APIs.

CONVENTIONS
===========
For Linux  : $TG_HOME refers to installation path where TayzGrid is 
             installed.        

For Windows: %TG_HOME% refers to the installation path where TayzGrid is 
             installed.

             
PREREQUISITES
=============
This sample program requires     

    - TG_HOME environment variable must be set. TG_HOME refers to installation 
      path where TayzGrid is installed. 

      To set TG_HOME For Linux: 

        - Open shell.
		- Type "export TG_HOME=/opt/tayzgrid" without quotes and press ENTER key. 
          Replace /opt/tayzgrid with the actual installation path if you have 
          installed TayzGrid on non-default location. 


      To set TG_HOME For Windows: 
        - Open Command Prompt.
        - type 'set TG_HOME="C:\Program Files\TayzGrid\"' without quotes 
          and press enter. 

    - jdk1.6 or higher
    - Netbeans v6 or later if you are using NetBeans to build and 
      run the project.
However any other preferred method can be used compile the source 
located at $TG_HOME/samples/dataproviders/src/


HOW TO CONFIGURE
=================
This sample program use the local cache "mypartitionedcache" for operations. 

Local cache "mypartitionedcache" can be started via:

	On Linux:
		- startcache tool located at $TG_HOME/bin/startcache.sh (linux)
		
	On Windows:
		- startcache tool located at %TG_HOME%/bin/tools/startcache.bat (windows)

    OR

    - TayzGrid Manager currently shipped only for Windows.


This sample program requires read through / write through providers to setup 
for cache.
  
    For Linux: 
	----------
	TayzGrid addbackingsource tool located at $TG_HOME/bin/addbackingsource
	
	It will take:
    - cache id: "mycache" for this sample
    - assembly path: $TG_HOME/samples/dataproviders/dist/dataproviders.jar
    - class name: com.alachisoft.tayzgrid.samples.data.Customer for this sample
    - provider name: any valid string value like "readthru" or "writethru"
    - read thru/write thru option: follow the process to setup
    - class attributes: _name, _age, _contactNo, _address, _gender
    - dependant assembly folder: path of any other assemblies or jar files
    
	Follow above steps for class com.alachisoft.tayzgrid.samples.data.Customer
	and attributes: _id, _name, _class, _category
    
  
    For Windows:
	------------
	TayzGrid  Manager -> Backing Source Tab
    - Click Add -> Browser -> Locate dataproviders.jar at:
        %TG_HOME%/samples/dataproviders/dist/dataproviders.jar
    - Under 'Selected Assemblies' select com.alachisoft.tayzgrid.samples.data.Product
        and com.alachisoft.tayzgrid.samples.data.Customer
    - Click add class -> Select all attributes under List of 'Selected Classes'
    - Press OK


HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN
======================
Make sure JAVA_HOME environment path variable is set. 
You can run already compiled sample shipped with TayzGrid located at:
 $TG_HOME/samples/dataproviders/dist/dataproviders.jar

	To Run already shipped sample
	-----------------------------
		- Switch directory to $TG_HOME/samples/dataproviders/dist/
		- TayzGrid 'java -jar dataproviders' without quotes to run the program.


	To Compile and Run via NetBeans:
	--------------------------------
		- Open Netbeans IDE.
		- Select File->Open Project
		- Locate $TG_HOME/samples/dataproviders
		- Add all .jar files to project libraries located at:
			   - $TG_HOME/lib
			   - $TG_HOME/lib/resources
		- Choose Run -> Clean and Build Project (Shift-F11) 
		- Press F6 to run the Project and observe output in NetBeans Output window.
	  
         OR

	To Compile and Run via Ant:
	---------------------------
		- Make sure $ANT_HOME environment path variable is set.
		- Start shell (terminal/cmd)
		- Change directory to $TG_HOME/samples/dataproviders
		- Type 'ant' (without quotes)
		- This will compile the source and will place dataproviders.jar at
			$TG_HOME/samples/dataproviders/dist/
		- Change directory to $TG_HOME/samples/dataproviders/dist/
		- TayzGrid 'java -jar dataproviders.jar' without quotes to run the program.
